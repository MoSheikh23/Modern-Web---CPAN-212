We built a complete backend server for managing drivers, vehicles, and trips.

We created separate sections for drivers, vehicles, and trips to keep everything organized.

We set up JSON files to store all our data like a simple database.

We added functions to create, read, update, and delete records for each section.

We built API routes so you can access drivers at /drivers, vehicles at /vehicles, and trips at /trips.

We added validation to check that all required information is provided correctly.

We implemented error handling to give clear messages when something goes wrong.

We made sure the server returns proper status codes for success and errors.

We kept the business logic separate from the routes for clean code.

We created a modular structure that makes the code easy to maintain and expand.

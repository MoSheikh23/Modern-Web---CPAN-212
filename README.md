Mohamed Sheikh - focused on defining access roles, securing backend routes, and implementing role-based access control (RBAC). He identified which routes should remain public (registration, login, OTP verification) and which must be protected by JWT authentication. He also mapped user roles to system permissions, ensuring that admins have full control while customers have limited access to viewing data. Mohamed developed the RBAC middleware (authenticate and authorize) that validates tokens and checks user roles before allowing access to protected endpoints. He integrated this middleware into all backend modules—Drivers, Vehicles, and Trips—clearly separating public, protected, and role-restricted routes. On the frontend, he implemented the main login page, token-based route protection through a ProtectedRoute component, and logout functionality to properly clear session data. His work ensured that the system enforces correct permissions and maintains secure access control across both backend and frontend.


Mohamed Mohamed - implemented the full authentication and multi-factor verification (MFA) workflow for the project. He built backend routes for email/password login, OTP generation, and OTP verification using Nodemailer and a temporary in-memory store. After validating credentials, his login handler generates a 6-digit OTP and emails it to the user, while the OTP verification route confirms identity and issues a signed JWT containing the user’s ID, email, and role. Mohamed also created the frontend OTP verification screen, allowing users to enter their code and receive their access token upon success. He configured Axios with an interceptor to automatically attach the JWT to all protected API requests, ensuring secure communication between frontend and backend. His work completed the entire MFA pipeline—login → OTP → JWT—and enabled secure authenticated sessions throughout the system.
